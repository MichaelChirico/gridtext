TODO
================
- complete textbox_grob(): alignment for rotated orientations doesn't work; height setting is not yet possible; we need halign and valign for internal content also

- implement some very basic handling of units in CSS

- rethink alignment? all boxes need to be able to indicate how they should be aligned,
  which needs to be handled by the parent box. Add halign()/valign() member functions?
