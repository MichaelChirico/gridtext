TODO
================
- complete `labels_grob()`. All graphical parameters need to be settable via `label_data`,
  including color, fontface, family, and size, background color, frame color, frame
  thickness, frame linestyle
- <p> should be displayed as a block element, not a line element (i.e., like <div>)
- text reflow and alignment needs to be implemented
- newlines need to be stripped from text. currently they are rendered, leading to strange results
- get font metrics directly from the graphics device rather than from grid? grid doesn't properly account for font size.
